#Cleanify

##Overview

A bot that beautifies html, js and css files inside your project.

##Problem

Everyone may not have beautifier plugins installed in their editor. So sometimes code written may be
messy. Cleanify solves that problem by allowing u to clean all your web files right from the command
line.

This is also useful for beautifying your server code, where you may not have access to any external
editors.

##Installation

First install dependencies. To do that run 

<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>

If you do not have the js-beautifier module for python installed, run ``install_jsbeautifier.sh```

##Contributing

No code is perfect, so feel free to send me a pull request or create a git issue :)
