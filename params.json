So sometimes code written may be\r\nmessy. And it's a pain to beautify all your files in one go. Cleanify solves that problem by allowing u to clean all your web files right from the command\r\nline.\r\n\r\nWhat's even better ? Cleanify **asynchronously** cleans up your files, so it's usable and fast, even for large projects.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nFirst install dependencies. To do that run \r\n\r\n<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>\r\n\r\nIf you do not have the js-beautifier module for python installed, run ```./install_jsbeautifier.sh```\r\n\r\n##Running\r\n<pre><code>python cleanify.py /path/to/dir</code></pre>\r\n\r\n##Contributing\r\n\r\nNo code is perfect, so feel free to send me a pull request or create a git issue :)\r\n\r\n##License\r\nhttp://www.tldrlegal.com/l/WTFPL\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
